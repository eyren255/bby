# Honeybun Anniversary Microsite

For Thazin Nwe â€” Honeybun ðŸ’• â€” 13 days (Jul 28, 2025)

A cute, animated, and fully self-contained microsite with mini games, love notes, and optional server sync for global leaderboards.

## Quick start (client-only, offline)
- Download/clone, then open `index.html` in a modern browser.

- The site works fully offline. Scores are stored locally.

## Optional: Start the server for syncing

cd server
npm install
cp .env.example .env
npm run start
```
Open Settings and set `Server URL` to `http://localhost:4000`, then enable "Sync scores to server".
