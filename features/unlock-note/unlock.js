Hey Honey Bun ðŸ’•,

Even when we're apart, you're always in my thoughts.
Your smile lights up even the darkest days.
Your voice is my favorite melody.
Your love is my favorite place.

I might not always say it right, but I mean it every time:
I love you. Always. Deeply. Truly. Softly.

Youâ€™re my happy place, my peace, my everything.

Forever yours,

â€“ Me ðŸ’Œ
